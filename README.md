# EXAMPLE AIXM WITH INSTRUMENT FLIGHT PROCEDURES

This dataset has been extracted from a NATS experimental dataset to provide isolated examples of Instrument Flight Procedures (AIXM [Procedures](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM51HTML/AIXM/Class_Procedure.html)).

It includes a typical example of one each of an [Instrument Approach Procedure](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM51HTML/AIXM/Class_InstrumentApproachProcedure.html), [Standard Instrument Departure](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM51HTML/AIXM/Class_StandardInstrumentDeparture.html) and [Standard Terminal Arrival Route](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM51HTML/AIXM/Class_StandardInstrumentArrival.html), and includes some features that have proven tricky to parse such as pointChoices.

This dataset was put together with the primary intent of assisting the development of parsers. It is not recommended for use for any other purpose.
